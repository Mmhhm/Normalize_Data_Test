Without indexing:
The query scans the data a sequential scan.
The execution time is more or less 140 ms.

Indexing:
The main scan goes through the air_force column,
so adding an index to the air_force column should
shorten the scanning time and lighten the execution
of the query.

With indexing:
The query scans the data using index scan.
The execution time is much shorter - around 60 ms.
